# Flume Ingestion for Real-Time Stock- Market Analysis with Spark and Hive
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis workflow within the Hadoop ecosystem, incorporating various ingestion methods, including API-driven approaches. The project covers direct file transfer, stream ingestion via Flume, and API-driven data ingestion using Sqoop. The data, sourced from Bitcoin blockchain and real-time stock markets, is efficiently collected and stored in HDFS. Integration of MySQL databases into HIVE is achieved seamlessly through Sqoop, while analytics leverage Pig, Hive, Spark Core, and Spark SQL for in-depth insights. The implemented end-to-end data pipelines ensure the extraction of meaningful financial information, fostering informed decision-making. All code, logs, and outputs are meticulously documented in Jupyter Notebooks, promoting transparency and reproducibility in the analytical process.
